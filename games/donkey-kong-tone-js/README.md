# Donkey Kong: tone.js

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/RedHenDev/pen/vRwrxX](https://codepen.io/RedHenDev/pen/vRwrxX).

Donkey Kong stress relief :) -- version using tone.js for when DK jumps, or when hits canvas bounds.

Click canvas to use keys. Or, drag Donkey Kong around with mouse/touch.

Made with matter.js and p5.js.
